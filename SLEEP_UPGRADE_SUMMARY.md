# Sleep Pipeline Upgrade: From Basic Aggregator to Robust Sleep Engine

## Overview
Successfully upgraded the sleep data pipeline from a basic duration aggregator to a comprehensive sleep analysis engine comparable to Whoop, Athlytic, and Bevel.

## Key Changes

### 1. Data Model Upgrade ✅
- **New `SleepSession` struct**: Stores complete sleep session with all metrics
- **New `SleepStages` struct**: Tracks Core, Deep, REM, and Awake stages
- **New `SleepMetrics` struct**: Advanced metrics (WASO, fragmentation, latency, consistency)
- **New `DailySleepSummary` struct**: Aggregated daily sleep data
- **Enhanced `HealthData`**: Now includes `sleepSession` with backward compatibility

### 2. Session Reconstruction Engine ✅
- **New `SleepSessionBuilder` class**: Core engine for reconstructing sleep sessions
- **Robust session detection**: Groups samples into contiguous sleep intervals
- **Cross-midnight handling**: Treats sleep sessions as single blocks until wake-up
- **Source prioritization**: Apple Watch > iPhone > Manual entries
- **Minimum session filtering**: Excludes short naps (<90 minutes)

### 3. Comprehensive Sleep Metrics ✅
- **Duration**: Total sleep time with optimal range scoring (7-9 hours)
- **Efficiency**: Sleep time / Time in bed (85%+ excellent)
- **Stage percentages**: REM (20-25%), Deep (15-20%), Core sleep
- **WASO**: Wake After Sleep Onset tracking
- **Fragmentation Index**: Wake events per hour
- **Sleep Latency**: Time to fall asleep
- **Consistency**: Bedtime/wake time patterns

### 4. Advanced Scoring Model ✅
**Weighted Sleep Score (0-100):**
- 40% Duration vs goal (7-9 hours optimal)
- 25% Efficiency (>85% excellent)
- 15% REM percentage (20-25% optimal)
- 15% Deep sleep percentage (15-20% optimal)
- 5% Fragmentation score (lower is better)
- WASO penalty (additional deduction)

### 5. Data Flow Architecture ✅
```
HealthKitManager
   ↓
SleepSessionBuilder (reconstructs sessions + metrics)
   ↓
DataManager (publishes session array + daily aggregates)
   ↓
ScoreManager (computes comprehensive sleep score)
   ↓
Views (show breakdown + score)
```

### 6. Edge Cases Handled ✅
- **Overlapping samples**: Priority-based source selection
- **Cross-midnight sessions**: Single session treatment
- **Short naps**: Filtered out (<90 minutes)
- **Missing data**: Graceful fallback to basic metrics
- **Multiple sources**: Apple Watch prioritization

## New Capabilities

### For Users:
- **Detailed sleep breakdown**: See REM, Deep, Core percentages
- **Sleep quality insights**: Efficiency, fragmentation, WASO
- **Comprehensive scoring**: Multi-factor sleep score like Whoop
- **Historical analysis**: 30-day sleep session tracking

### For Developers:
- **Extensible architecture**: Easy to add new sleep metrics
- **Robust session handling**: Handles complex sleep patterns
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing code continues to work
- **Performance optimized**: Parallel data loading

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified:
1. `Models/HealthData.swift` - New sleep data models
2. `Services/SleepSessionBuilder.swift` - Session reconstruction engine
3. `Services/HealthKitManager.swift` - Session-based data fetching
4. `Utilities/HealthCalculator.swift` - Comprehensive sleep scoring
5. `Services/DataManager.swift` - Session data binding
6. `Services/ScoreManager.swift` - Advanced sleep score computation

### New Methods:
- `fetchSleepSessions()` - Get comprehensive sleep sessions
- `fetchDailySleepSummary()` - Get daily sleep summary
- `buildSessions()` - Reconstruct sessions from HealthKit samples
- `comprehensiveSleepScore()` - Multi-factor sleep scoring
- `loadSleepSessions30Days()` - Historical sleep data

## Benefits

- Historical trend analysis

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
- **Sleep consistency scoring**: Bedtime/wake time patterns
- **Sleep debt tracking**: Cumulative sleep deficit
- **Recovery correlation**: Sleep quality vs recovery metrics
- **Personalized recommendations**: Based on sleep patterns
- **Sleep coaching**: Actionable insights and tips

### Advanced Features:
- **Sleep stage prediction**: ML-based stage estimation
